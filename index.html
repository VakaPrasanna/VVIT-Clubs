        <p>The Music Club is always at the forefront of institutional events like Independence Day, Republic Day etc., mesmerizing everyone with their unique performances. Besides the institutional events, Music Club also hosts its own events. The first event of the year is CHORDS where the freshers of the club get a chance to showcase their talent. And believe us when we say that the freshers enter the club with a bang! Just as the second semester of the year is beginning and classes are making life dreary, Music Club brings the color back into college life with our next event, ENCORE. And as all always, the audience is left wanting more.</p>
